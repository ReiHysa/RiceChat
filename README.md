Project Four: RiceChat

This project was similar to my project 3 which was social media as I had to make both the front and backend of the program. However, this specific project
differed in the language that was used. Here I learnt Django which meant I had to learn python. Learning a new code was exciting and challenging but 
I thoroughly enjoyed learning it.

What is Ricechat?

Ricechat is a live messaging service where messages can be sent directly to a person through searching their name. You do this by creating your own
personal account and searching for other users. The aim was to create a service which has live updating messages in real time while using backend
rather then sending messages directly through a server. I knew after my third project called : Journi that I wanted to develop my idea of social media
by introducing a messaging service which I could later combine to make a one functional service if desired.

What was something I struggled on?

My journey was met with many troubles such as the backend. It was a new coding language and I felt like I had jumped straight into the deep end, but luckily
I was able to get the backend working in a functional way. The relationships included one to one and many to many relationships. Each message has it's own
owner and it has it's own relationship to specific chats that It was written in. The front and backend work hand in hand to do this by creating a message and then
posting the last message you sent to the chat that you are on. Creating a relationship between the message and the chat sent.
This was a clever work around in incorporating ownership of messages and inclusion within chats but while doing the front end I felt like it could have been
done simpler if the backend was more organised. However, that aside I felt like the backend was good enough to make a functioning code that works. 

What am I proud of?

What I am proud of via the code is the live updating feature. The live updating feature works for both the creation of new chats and the sending of new
messages between people. As a message is sent between a person and someone else, the server does a constant check on the length of the amount of messages
within the chat. If the new length of messages is no longer equal to the old length of messages, it will update the page with the new messages.
This includes the deleting of messages as well. This is also similar to the chat service, if a chat is deleted then the chat list is updated to show that
no chats are there. I decided to do it so it would delete for both parties as often social media messages are saved on one device but not the other. 
This overall is more useful but I felt like changing it by deleting it so the messages are no longer existing to include an extra layer of privacy.

Although the project may be considered simple, the execution was extremely tough. It involved a lot of problems throughout the week and forced me to 
constantly rework my code to get it functioning. This code challenged me and forced me to do workarounds to problem solve the areas in which I thought
I was stuck. I am extremely proud of this project as not only was it really challenging but it involved a topic in which I had a strong passion of learning.
I would love to do a messaging service again and develop the code that I had already learnt and find out new methods in doing it!
